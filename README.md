# Concepts

We're enriching concepts with data from external sources and constructing a knowledge graph to improve the experience of searching, exploring and discovering new stuff on [wellcomecollection.org](https://wellcomecollection.org).

## What's a concept?

Works can be tagged with subjects, contributors, genres, languages, etc. Any of these taggable entities which are not works themselves should be considered a concept.

## What's enrichment?

Currently, we're ingesting and connecting data from [LCSH](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Subject_Headings), [MeSH](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Subject_Headings), and [wikidata](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikidata) to enrich concepts. These provide us with variant names, descriptions, useful dates, and connections to neighbouring concepts, among other things.
By incorporating these sources, we can demonstrate a deeper understanding of each concept and a richer experience of exploring the collection online.
